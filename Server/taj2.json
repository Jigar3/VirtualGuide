            "description": "Here, at the heart of the Taj Mahal, are the cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. Surrounding the empty tombs is an exquisite marble screen and framing the arches of the chamber are numerous examples of elegant calligraphic inscriptions and elaborate inlay design. The placing of the cenotaph of Shah Jahan may be the only element of the Taj Mahal, which does not illustrate symmetrical precision. Excluded from original plans, the Emperor's resting place was somewhat of an afterthought and clearly overlaps the floor pattern, which frames the cenotaph of his wife, Mumtaz",
